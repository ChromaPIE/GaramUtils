# GaramUtils

### Vencord plugin bringing actual QoL improvements to Garam bot.

Credits to Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Of course I can't code it purely on my own.

(But also me, my patient writing long ahh prompts and shallow but necessary knowledge for getting everything running on the right track or it would be a complete hot mess.)

## Features

- **Copy code** button under your `/drop` cards
- Also **Price range** button to execute `/sell manual code:[CODE] price:1` automatically for the warning showing market price range of the card.
- Also **/sell auto** button to.. Guess what it does.
- **View card** button under `/daily` cards for its copy number. It should've been on the bot's side but well.
- More planned. Open issue or ping me on Discord. You know where to find me.

### Configurables

- **Auto Send Commands**: Auto-send command instead of leaving it in chatbox. DEFAULT: OFF
- **Copy Code With Price Range**: Copy code when checking Price range. DEFAULT: OFF
